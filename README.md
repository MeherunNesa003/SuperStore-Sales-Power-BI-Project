1. Project Title

🏪 Superstore Sales Insights: Interactive Analytics Dashboard
A dynamic Power BI dashboard designed to analyze sales, profit, and customer trends across categories, regions, and time periods—built as part of a guided learning project.

2. Short Description

The Superstore Sales Dashboard is an educational Power BI project created from a YouTube tutorial dataset. It demonstrates how sales and profit data can be visualized across categories, sub-categories, regions, and shipping modes. The purpose is to practice data visualization, DAX, and forecasting skills while showcasing how analytics can uncover actionable insights in retail sales.

3. Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Main platform for dashboard creation.

📂 Power Query – Data cleaning, shaping, and transformation.

🧮 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used to build KPIs, measures, and custom calculations.

📝 Data Modeling – Structured relationships between orders, products, customers, and regions.

📁 File Formats – .pbix for development, .pdf and .png for documentation and sharing.

4. Data Source

Source: Sample “Superstore Sales” dataset provided in the YouTube tutorial.

The dataset includes:

Sales Data: Category, sub-category, product-level sales and order quantities.

Customer Segments: Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office.

Shipping Modes: Standard Class, Second Class, First Class, Same Day.

Regions & States: Sales distribution across U.S. states and regions.

Profit & Forecasting: Monthly profit trends and 15-day sales forecasting.

(Note: This dataset is not real business data—it is a sample dataset shared in the tutorial for learning purposes.)

5. Features / Highlights
• Business Problem (Learning Scenario)

Retail companies generate huge amounts of sales data across products, customers, and geographies. Without proper visualization, it is difficult to identify top-performing categories, track regional demand, or forecast future sales.

• Goal of the Dashboard

To build a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that:

Provides insights into sales, profit, and order trends.

Visualizes performance across categories, customer segments, and shipping methods.

Demonstrates forecasting capabilities for short-term sales prediction.

• Walkthrough of Key Visuals
